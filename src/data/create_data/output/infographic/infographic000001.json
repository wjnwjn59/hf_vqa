The overall visual style is professional and scientific, featuring a clean, neutral palette of blues, grays, and whites to reflect clarity and data-driven focus. The horizontal composition flows from left to right, following a structured narrative that begins with the definition of albedo, progresses through its natural and human influences, and concludes with its role in climate systems. The layout hierarchy is balanced, with the left side introducing foundational concepts, the center elaborating on key mechanisms like the ice-albedo feedback, and the right side highlighting human impacts and future implications. The infographic includes a variety of visuals such as graphs, diagrams, and comparative charts, with a particular emphasis on the ice-albedo feedback cycle and albedo range comparisons. It also features quantitative data such as albedo percentages and changes over time, making it informative and accessible to students, educators, and environmental professionals. The purpose is to explain the concept of albedo, its role in climate systems, and its impact from both natural and human sources, promoting awareness and understanding of climate dynamics.",

The design adopts a dark, ironic, and provocative visual style, reflecting the satirical tone of the original work. The color palette is monochrome with red accents for emphasis and subtle green tones to evoke Ireland. The layout follows a horizontal, left-to-right narrative flow, divided into four main sections: left, center, right, and a concluding right-side panel. The infographic uses a combination of symbolic figures, textual overlays, and charts to convey the satirical intent and historical context. The left section presents the plight of the Irish poor, the center section introduces the satirical 'proposal' and its justification, the right section critiques societal attitudes and highlights the absurdity of the idea. The intended audience includes educated readers, students of literature and history, and those interested in satire and social critique. The purpose is to summarize the content, satirical intent, and historical context of *A Modest Proposal* in a visually engaging and informative manner, while maintaining a clear and informative design.",
