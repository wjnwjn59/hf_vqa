The horizontal composition flows from left to right, following a logical narrative that guides the viewer through the concept of albedo and its broader implications. The layout is balanced, with the left side dedicated to foundational concepts, the center to key processes, and the right side to human impacts and future implications. The infographic includes a mix of diagrams, charts, and textual labels, emphasizing clarity and visual hierarchy. Visual elements such as graphs, satellite imagery, and symbolic representations of albedo ranges are used to illustrate the topic. The intended audience includes students, educators, and environmental professionals, and the purpose is to explain the concept of albedo, its role in climate systems, and its impact from both natural and human sources. The design aims to be informative, accessible, and visually engaging, supporting educational and professional understanding of albedo and its relevance to climate science.",
