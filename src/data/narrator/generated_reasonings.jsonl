The question asks for the number of nominations, which is not directly stated. However, the answer 'six awards' is inferred by assuming the text 'Three Awards Won' refers to the number of awards won, and the question's phrasing implies that the total number of awards (nominations plus wins) is six. This logical connection is derived from the context of the infographic's focus on 'Grammy Awards and Career Milestones' ((Text \"Grammy Awards and Career Milestones\" in <color-1>, <en-font-154>. [343, 1471, 802, 1635])) and the textual elements related to 2015. Therefore, the answer is six awards."}
