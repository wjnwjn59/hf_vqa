In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.",

In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

    "context": "Beyoncé's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community. Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments. In 2008, L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\", and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".",
