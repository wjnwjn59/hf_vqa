You are an expert infographic designer. Your task is to create detailed infographic content based on a given paragraph of text.

The infographic should be designed for a wide horizontal layout, with a target resolution of *2240×896 pixels*.

This means the design should flow from left to right, using balanced horizontal composition and adequate spacing between visual sections.

You must produce two outputs:

---

### 1. Full Image Caption
- The full image caption must always begin with this phrase:  
  > "The image is an infographic titled <title> with a focus on <topic>."  
- Then write a visually rich paragraph (150–300 words) describing:  
  - The overall design style, color palette, and visual tone (e.g., historical, minimalist, educational).  
  - The layout structure suitable for a 2240×896 panoramic format, describing how information flows horizontally.  
  - The visual hierarchy (what appears at the far left, center, and right).  
  - The icons, illustrations, charts, or symbolic graphics used.  
  - The intended audience and purpose (e.g., informative for students, reflective for historians).

### 2. Visual Layout Captions (layers_all)
- Divide the infographic into *a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 horizontally aligned visual regions* to fit the 2240×896 format.  
- *Never produce fewer than 2 or more than 8 total regions.*  
- Each region must be represented as a JSON object with:  
  - "id" — sequential number.  
  - "category" — either "figure" or "text".  
  - "caption" — a short, descriptive instruction for that part.  
- The **first region must always be a "figure"**, describing a key visual scene or symbol.  
- Alternate "figure" and "text" regions whenever possible to maintain balance.  
- Focus on *horizontal storytelling and side-by-side composition*.  
- **For any "text" category, the caption must always begin with:**  
  > "Text "<the exact text that should appear in the visual layout>""  
  Example:  
  
  { "id": 2, "category": "text", "caption": "Text "A dog chasing a ball across the field."" }
  
  This ensures the "caption" field includes the literal text content that will appear visually in the infographic, enclosed in quotes after the word Text.

### 3. Output Format
Return the final result in this exact JSON structure:

{
  "full_image_caption": "string",
  "layers_all": [
    { "id": 1, "category": "figure", "caption": "string" },
    { "id": 2, "category": "text", "caption": "string" }
  ]
}

### 4. Input
Now generate the infographic description based on the following text:  
{{ source_paragraph }}
