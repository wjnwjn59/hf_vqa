You are an expert infographic designer and visual communication strategist. Your task is to generate a structured infographic design plan in JSON format based on the provided Infographic Design Brief String. Use only the information explicitly present in the brief; do not hallucinate, infer, or invent any new facts or visuals.

Design target: panoramic horizontal layout at 2240×896 pixels with a left-to-right narrative flow and balanced spacing.

You must produce exactly two outputs in JSON: a detailed "full_image_caption" and a structured "layers_all" array.

---

### 1) FULL IMAGE CAPTION
Begin with:
"The image is an infographic titled `<TITLE>` with a focus on `<TOPIC>`."

Then write **200–350 words** describing:
- The overall visual style, tone, and color palette.
- The left-to-right layout composition (left, center, right).
- The hierarchy of visual regions.
- The types of visuals, symbols, charts, or diagrams included.
- The intended audience and purpose.
- **Every textual element that appears in the infographic must be explicitly included in the caption.**
  
Concretely, the "full_image_caption" must **restate all texts that appear later in the `"category": "text"` items**, in natural narrative form. For example, if the infographic contains text elements such as numbered points, slogans, or data labels, you must weave those lines directly into this caption exactly as written. The text must be fully quoted and not paraphrased in the form of \"<the exact text that should appear in the visual layout>\". For example: The image is an infographic titled \"Women's Skin Care Habits\".

If style or visual detail is unspecified, use neutral phrasing such as “a clear and informative design.”

### 2) VISUAL LAYOUT CAPTIONS ("layers_all")
Represent the infographic as a horizontally ordered list of regions corresponding to the panoramic layout.

Each region must be a JSON object with:
- `"id"`: sequential integer starting from 1  
- `"category"`: one of `"figure"` or `"text"`  
- `"caption"`: short descriptive instruction (for visuals) or literal content (for text)

**Ordering rule:**
1. The first region must be `"category": "figure"` describing the full background appearance (colors, textures, or patterns that span the entire image).
2. Subsequent `"figure"` elements (if any) describe local illustrations or icons.  
3. All `"text"` elements appear afterward in reading order.

---

**Guidelines for each category:**

- For the first `"figure"`:
  - Begin with: “The image background features …”
  - Describe overall background tone, gradients, or patterns covering the full canvas.

- For `"figure"`:
  - Begin with: “The picture contains”, “The picture features”, “The picture shows”, or “The image features”.
  - Describe what the figure depicts, based strictly on the brief.
  - No text mention unless it is part of the visual element.

- For `"text"`:
  - Begin each caption exactly as:
    `Text "<the exact text that should appear in the visual layout>"`
  - Do not paraphrase or summarize; copy the exact wording from the brief.

### 3) OUTPUT FORMAT
Return the result in exactly this JSON structure:

{
  "full_image_caption": "string",
  "layers_all": [
    { "id": 1, "category": "figure", "caption": "string" },
    { "id": 2, "category": "figure", "caption": "string" },
    { "id": 3, "category": "figure", "caption": "string" },
    { "id": 4, "category": "text",   "caption": "Text \"...\"" }
  ]
}

### 4) INPUT
Use the following Infographic Design Brief String as the only source of truth.
Do not add, infer, or modify information beyond it.
