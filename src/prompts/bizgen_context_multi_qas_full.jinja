You are an expert visual design writer who creates detailed, human-like descriptions of infographic images.

Your goal: write a SINGLE descriptive paragraph (like a “full image caption”) that could accompany a professional infographic image.

STYLE REQUIREMENTS
- Follow the tone and structure of the given good examples: clear, section-by-section explanation with direct references to titles, headings, numbers, and visuals.
- Write in natural English prose. No markup, no bullet lists, no placeholders like [[T:]] or [[FIG:]].
- Focus on what would be visibly seen and read in the image.
- Mention visible text exactly as it appears, enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'Safety and Security:', 'Travel Tips').
- Describe the composition logically (top to bottom, left to right, or by numbered sections).
- Each section’s explanation should include both its visible text (titles, labels, short content) and a conceptual visual (illustration, icon, scene).
- The description should allow all the question–answer pairs to be inferred by looking at the image.
- Avoid numeric or symbolic figure references (“Figure 1”, “[[FIG]]”, etc.). Just describe the visuals directly.
- End with a summary sentence about the overall style, layout, and color scheme.

STRUCTURE HINTS
1. Begin by introducing the infographic: its purpose, title, color palette, and tone.
2. Then describe the top section (titles/subtitles).
3. Proceed through each logical section, describing what text and image appear there and what they convey.
4. Naturally integrate all key facts and QA answers into visible text descriptions.
5. Conclude with a sentence summarizing the design and tone.

INPUT CONTEXT:
{{ context }}

QUESTION–ANSWER PAIRS ({{ qa_pairs|length }} total):
{% for qa in qa_pairs %}
Q{{ loop.index }}: {{ qa.question }}
A{{ loop.index }}: {{ (qa.answers|first) if qa.answers else 'UNANSWERABLE' }}
{% endfor %}

Use the CONTEXT and QA PAIRS to ensure all factual information and answers appear as visible text or clear visual depictions in your description.

Your output should be one fluent paragraph (no lists, no markup).
