### FULL IMAGE CAPTION RULES

Write 250–400 words describing the infographic **from top to bottom**.  
Start with:
> "The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>"."  

Then:
- Include **texts or phrases** that directly express the key answers to the questions  
- Arrange text and figures logically so that a viewer can infer the answers visually  
- Use clear sectioning and descriptive visuals

For figures, use:
`[CATEGORY] description of the image`

Allowed categories:
- `[straight]` — literal illustration of an answer  
- `[composite]` — multiple scenes or comparative visuals that together answer a question  
- `[metaphorical]` — symbolic representation that implies an answer through analogy

Ensure the infographic contains **enough information** so each question can be answered correctly without external knowledge.  
Focus on visual clarity and relevance over completeness of the original text.

### BACKGROUND CAPTION RULES

Describe the **background only** (colors, gradients, textures).  
It must match the environment or mood of the infographic, as described in the full caption.  
Do not mention text or figures.
