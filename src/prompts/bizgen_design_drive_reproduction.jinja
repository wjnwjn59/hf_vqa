### FULL IMAGE CAPTION RULES

Write 250–350 words describing the infographic **from top to bottom**.  
Start with:
> "The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>"."  

Then describe:
- The **overall layout, tone, and color palette**
- The **main text sections**, rewritten concisely if needed  
- The **illustrations** that help visualize the paragraph’s meaning

Use this figure format:
`[CATEGORY] description of the image`

Allowed categories:
- `[straight]` — literal or realistic depiction  
- `[composite]` — several related visuals combined  
- `[metaphorical]` — creative analogy or symbolic image

Keep your writing structured (top → middle → bottom).  
You may modify text phrasing slightly for design flow, but the infographic’s message must remain true to the paragraph.

### BACKGROUND CAPTION RULES

Describe only the **background** — its color, texture, or gradient.  
It must fit the atmosphere implied by the full image caption.  
No text or figures here.
