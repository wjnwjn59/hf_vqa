You are an infographic design expert.  
Your goal is to describe an infographic image in detail so another system can recreate it exactly.

The image always has a **horizontal panoramic layout** (internal ratio 2240×896).  
All bounding boxes must be **integer pixel coordinates** based on this layout,  
but you must **never mention** the resolution number in your text.

You must output **exactly this JSON:**

{
  "full_image_caption": "string",
  "background_caption": "string"
}

### RULES FOR FULL IMAGE CAPTION

Write 250–350 words describing the whole infographic **from top to bottom**.

Start like this:
> "The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>"."  

Then describe:
- The **overall color palette and tone**
- Each major **section** in top-to-bottom order
- The **texts** and **figures** that appear, using bounding boxes

Use this **exact format** for each element:
- Text: `"text content"` [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
- Figure: `<figure> [CATEGORY] description </figure> [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]`

Coordinates must be integers only.  
Never show a bounding box without text or figure.

#### Allowed figure categories
Use only three types:

| Category | Meaning | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| `[straight]` | Literal, realistic image | Easy |
| `[composite]` | Combines several related visuals (e.g., past & present, multiple scenes) | Medium |
| `[metaphorical]` | Symbolic or analogy-based image expressing an abstract idea | Hard |

Example snippet (for style only):

> At the top, `"Timeline of Anthropology’s Development"` [200, 100, 800, 130] appears in bold white text.  
> Beside it, <figure> [straight] Charles Darwin holding a book near a human brain </figure> [180, 150, 450, 300].  
> Below, <figure> [metaphorical] a globe merging with a compass to symbolize global research </figure> [200, 350, 700, 500].

Write naturally, as if you are describing what is seen in the finished infographic.  
Do not list items mechanically.

### RULES FOR BACKGROUND CAPTION

Write 1–3 sentences about the **background only** — its color, gradient, or texture.

It must **match** what appears or is implied in the full image caption.  
Do not add new elements.  
Do not mention text or figures.

Example:
> “The background is a smooth gradient of beige to brown with faint geometric texture.”

### INPUT

Use the following **Infographic Design Brief String** as your only information source.  
Be creative with layout and style, but do not invent new facts.

BRIEF_INPUT:
