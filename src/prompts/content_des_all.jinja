You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. Your objective is to transform content from a text-based Question Answering (QA) dataset into a structured description for an infographic that will later be used in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset.

Specifically, generate a single, detailed caption for an infographic image from a context and all of its question-answer pairs input. The caption should describe the layout from top to middle to bottom and enumerate all planned visible text and figures that will appear in the infographic. Each planned element should be described in a double quoted for later post-processing for downstream generation: write text items as "\"<text>\" (text)" and figure captions as "\"<caption>\" (figure)", including the title and the topic. Use only relative placement terms, and avoid exact colors, font names, and precise coordinates.

You are given:
1) A short paragraph ("CONTEXT") describing an event, profile, definition, or story.
2) A list of question–answer pairs ("QA LIST"), each answerable from the CONTEXT.
Use only these inputs and do not invent facts.

Return only the full image caption as a single string.

Follow these rules:

A) Opening and global conventions
• Begin with one sentence that starts exactly: "The image is an infographic titled \"<TITLE>\" (text) focused on \"<TOPIC>\" (text)."  
• After the opening sentence, you may write short narrative sentences for flow and relative placement (top, middle, bottom).  
• Each planned text or figure must be expressed as its **own line** containing only a double quoted string immediately followed by the tag (text) for text item or (figure) for figure caption.
• Provide at least two figure captions supporting major QA-relevant ideas.  
• Use only relative placement (near, adjacent, above, below, left of, right of).
• Do not mention exact colors or font names; high-level typography cues like bold or uppercase are acceptable if helpful.  
• End the final sentence with: "The overall style of the image is ..." and complete it concisely.

B) Figure captions — quoted and ending with (figure)
• Each figure caption must be its own standalone line formatted exactly as: "\"<caption>\" (figure)"; nothing else on that line.
• Do not include quoted strings inside a figure caption.
• Do not include numbers or proper nouns, in figure captions (no years, counts, percentages, named people, organizations, places, or product titles).
• Do not depict numerical charts or diagrams in figure captions; avoid bars, lines, axes, ticks, scales, or data encodings. Prefer icons, illustrations, scenes, or symbolic visuals that support the questions.
• The figure must be rendered in a cartoon or illustrative style and must not contain letters, numerals, words, acronyms, or logos of any kind.
• If the content involves humans, begin the description with phrasing such as "a cartoon…", "a stylized…", or "a silhouette…" to emphasize the illustrative style and avoid identity cues.

C) Text items — quoted and ending with (text)
• Write each text item as a natural short phrase (about six or more words), not bare keywords.  
• Draw wording primarily from the CONTEXT; use words from QUESTIONS for salience and ANSWER tokens only as factual anchors (exact dates, years, counts, proper names).  
• Reproduce numbers, dates, and units exactly; keep casing and terms consistent with the CONTEXT.  
• If a detail is ambiguous or unsupported, omit it rather than guessing.  
• Indicate roles naturally (title, section header, label, list entry, footnote, URL) and describe placement only in relative terms.

D) Evidence and safety
• Include salient keywords as "\"<text>\" (text)" when literal answers would be awkward (for example, yes/no or long clauses) so answers can be inferred from visuals.  
• Place high-importance keywords near their supporting visuals using only relative terms.  
• Do not contradict the CONTEXT; omit unsupported details. Exclude hateful, sexual, self-harm, or dangerous content. Do not mention URLs or sources.

Inputs:
– CONTEXT: {{ context }}
– QA_LIST: {% for qa in qa_list %}Q: {{ qa.question }} | A: {{ qa.answer }}{% if not loop.last %} || {% endif %}{% endfor %}
