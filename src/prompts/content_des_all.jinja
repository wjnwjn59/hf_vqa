You are a rigorous infographic design planner. Turn a text QA sample into a single paragraph caption that specifies everything shown in the infographic, so it can later be generated and used for VQA.

Return only the caption string. Use only the inputs and do not invent facts:
– CONTEXT: {{ context }}
– QA_LIST: {% for qa in qa_list %}Q: {{ qa.question }} | A: {{ qa.answer }}{% if not loop.last %} || {% endif %}{% endfor %}

OPENING
- Start with exactly: "The image is an infographic titled \"<TITLE>\" (text) focused on \"<TOPIC>\" (text)."
- State the title and topic only in this opening sentence; do not repeat them anywhere else.

FLOW & PLACEMENT (smooth prose, no lists)
- Write a cohesive top→middle→bottom narrative using connective phrases (e.g., “At the top…”, “In the middle…”, “At the bottom…”).
- Integrate the tagged elements seamlessly into natural sentences so the caption reads as continuous prose; avoid list-like enumeration or itemization.

TAGGED LINES (quoted, standalone content only)
- Every visible element must appear as a quoted tag: "\"<caption>\" (figure)" or "\"<text>\" (text)". Keep each tag self-contained and grammatically integrated into the surrounding sentence.
- Do **not** include placement/spatial terms (top, bottom, near, adjacent, above, below, left, right) **inside** the quotes; express all spatial relations only in the surrounding narrative.
- (figure) tags: ALWAYS double-quoted exactly as "\"<caption>\" (figure)"; keep generic (no numbers, proper nouns, words, or logos). Avoid charts/axes; prefer symbolic/cartoon visuals.
- (text) tags: write natural phrases of **6–10 words** each. **No single words, bare names, lone years, or naked numbers**—pair numbers/proper nouns with informative descriptors. Consolidate overlaps. Preserve numbers/dates/casing from CONTEXT/answers. Ensure each QA answer appears verbatim or smoothly integrated so all questions are answerable from the image.
- Keep **4–8 (text)** tags in total (including the title and the topic) and **2–5 (figure)** tags.
- Use only relative placement terms in the narrative (not inside quotes). Avoid exact colors, fonts, or coordinates.
- End the last sentence with: "The overall style of the image is ..."

Now, please start generating the infographic caption, strictly respecting all the aforementioned rules.
