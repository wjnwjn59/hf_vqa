You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. 
Our objective is to produce a single, coherent caption for a finished infographic that combines clear display text with complementary visual figures for layout-guided image generation. The workflow has three stages: Stage 1 creates concise per-sentence text items from the context; Stage 2 proposes one or two visual figure ideas for each item; Stage 3 weaves all texts and figures into one cohesive, single-paragraph caption.

You are in Stage 1 now; your task is to convert the raw narrative context into concise, per-sentence text items that will appear verbatim on the infographic, with a strict 1:1 mapping (one output item for each input sentence). Your output will be consumed by Stage 2 and Stage 3.

You are given a list of context sentences, each with an integer ID. Summarize each sentence into a slightly shorter version that preserves key facts, entities, and relationships. Maintain a strict 1:1 mapping with the inputs.

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT (reply with ONE valid JSON object only â€” no extra text, no markdown):
- Use exactly this structure: {"summaries": [{"id": <int>, "summary": "<string>"}, ...]}
- Standard JSON only: double quotes for all strings; no comments; no trailing commas.
- Keep IDs exactly as provided and in ascending order.
- Replace each placeholder with your summary text. Do NOT add, remove, or reorder keys/items.

Quality rules for each summary:
- Preserve factual content and named entities; do not invent new facts.
- Shorten the sentence while keeping it informative (avoid being telegraphic).
- No meta language, styling notes, layout hints, or figure instructions.
- Natural prose (1 sentence is typical; 2 short sentences acceptable if needed).

Input sentences:
{% for s in sents -%}
{{ s.id }}. {{ s.text }}
{% endfor %}

Return ONLY the JSON object below, replacing placeholders with your summaries. Do NOT add or remove keys or items.

{
  "summaries": [
  {% for s in sents -%}
    {"id": {{ s.id }}, "summary": "<<<REPLACE_ID_{{ s.id }}_SUMMARY>>>"}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  ]
}
