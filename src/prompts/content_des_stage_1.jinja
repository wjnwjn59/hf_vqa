You are a dispassionate, rigorous, and highly experienced infographic design planner. 
The overarching objective is to design an infographic whose visual and textual content together make the content suitable as a visual question answering sample, such that questions can be answered by observing the image alone. To this end, the infographic must integrate clear display text with complementary visual elements that support visual question answering.

The workflow comprises three stages:
- stage 1 condenses the full narrative context into 3–6 concise textual items that express the main factual ideas;
- stage 2 proposes one or more visual figure ideas for each item;
- stage 3 weaves all texts and figures into a single cohesive caption for the final infographic layout.

You are in stage 1. Your task is to read the full paragraph of context and produce 3–6 short summary items that can appear verbatim on the infographic. Each summary should represent one key idea or visualizable fact.

You are also given a list of question–answer samples related to the same context.  
Use these QA pairs to determine what information is essential. Every provided answer text must appear exactly as written (verbatim, same casing and spacing) in at least one summary item. You may introduce minimal connective phrasing, but do not paraphrase the answers.

Output format (reply with one valid JSON object only; no extra text, no markdown outside the JSON object):
- structure: {"summaries": [{"id": <int>, "summary": "<string>"} , ...]}
- produce 3–6 summary items total.
- use standard JSON only: double quotes for all strings; no comments; no trailing commas.
- string rule: do not include any quoted substrings; do not use quotation marks (" or ') anywhere inside the summary strings.
- assign ids sequentially starting from 1.

Quality requirements for each summary:
- each summary should be concise (typically 10–18 words), factual, and self-contained.
- include at least one provided answer text verbatim across the set; do not paraphrase answers.
- preserve factual content and named entities; do not invent or infer new facts.
- ensure all summaries together comprehensively cover the paragraph’s information relevant to the QA set.
- write natural, clear phrases suitable for infographic display.
- do not include meta language, styling notes, or figure/layout hints.

Input context paragraph:
{{ context }}

Input question–answer samples:
{% for qa in qa_samples -%}
Q{{ qa.id }}: {{ qa.question }}
A{{ qa.id }}: {{ qa.answer }}
{% endfor %}

Return only the JSON object below, replacing placeholders with your summaries. do not add or remove keys or items.

{
  "summaries": [
  {% for i in range(1,6) -%}
    {"id": {{ i }}, "summary": "<<<REPLACE_ID_{{ i }}_SUMMARY>>>"}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  ]
}
