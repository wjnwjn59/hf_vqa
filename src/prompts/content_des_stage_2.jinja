You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. 
Our objective is to produce a single, coherent caption for a finished infographic that combines clear display text with complementary visual figures for layout-guided image generation. The workflow has three stages: Stage 1 creates concise per-sentence text items from the context; Stage 2 proposes visual figure ideas for each item; Stage 3 weaves all texts and figures into one cohesive, single-paragraph caption.

You are in Stage 2 now; your task is to propose a **MAIN** visual idea for each text item from Stage 1 that conveys its meaning without any lettering. You **may also** provide **one SUPPORTIVE small figure** (optional), such as a simple abstract shape arrangement (e.g., “The image features a simple, abstract design with a blue circle and a black rectangle.”). Note: in Stage 3, all figure ideas from this stage will be included in the final caption and may be placed anywhere in the narrative (no assumed one-to-one or local pairing).

You are given with the items below which are the per-sentence summaries generated in Stage 1. For each summary, produce:
- **One required MAIN idea** (detailed, faithful scene description).
- **Zero or one optional SUPPORTIVE micro-figure** (brief abstract/iconic aid).

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT (reply with ONE valid JSON object only — no extra text, no markdown):
- Use exactly these keys and structure: {"figures": [{"id": <int>, "ideas": ["<MAIN>", "<SUPPORTIVE?>"]}, ...]}
- Use standard JSON with double quotes for all strings.
- No comments, no trailing commas.
- Keep IDs exactly as provided and in ascending order.
- The **first element** of each "ideas" array **must be the MAIN idea**.
- If you do **not** provide a supportive idea, **delete** the second placeholder **and its comma** so the JSON remains valid.
- Do NOT add, remove, or reorder items or keys.

Quality rules:
- **MAIN idea (required):** 1–3 sentences, ~25–80 words; neutral, declarative prose; describe primary subject(s), salient attributes (e.g., color/pattern), action/pose, immediate setting/background, and simple composition cues when useful; no new facts; no lettering.
- **SUPPORTIVE idea (optional):** 1 sentence, ~5–20 words; simple abstract/iconic aid (shapes, minimal icons, small motif); must be visually helpful but not redundant; no lettering.
- Mood phrasing: use careful language for visually implied states (e.g., “appears to be happy”).
- Counting & structure: state clear counts; for abstract graphics, name shapes and arrangement.
- Placement-neutral: do not claim or prescribe where a figure will appear relative to any text; Stage 3 may place figures anywhere.
- Avoid blanks unless the summary explicitly calls for emptiness/minimalism.
- No camera/style jargon or prompt-engineering tokens. No brands or real-person identification.

Stage-1 Summaries:
{% for it in items -%}
{{ it.id }}. {{ it.summary }}
{% endfor %}

Return ONLY the JSON object below, replacing placeholders with your descriptions. Do NOT add or remove keys or items. If you provide only the MAIN idea, delete the second placeholder (and its comma).

{
  "figures": [
  {% for it in items -%}
    {"id": {{ it.id }}, "ideas": [
      "<<<REPLACE_ID_{{ it.id }}_MAIN>>>"
      , "<<<REPLACE_ID_{{ it.id }}_SUPPORTIVE>>>"
    ]}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  ]
}
