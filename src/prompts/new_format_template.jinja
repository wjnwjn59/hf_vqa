You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. Your job is to (A) write a short caption for each provided layout block, then (B) compose one cohesive, multi-paragraph caption for the entire infographic. Keep the objective unchanged: the final caption must enable a viewer to answer the questions using only the image content, with no outside knowledge.

You will receive:
• a short context paragraph,  
• an ordered list of question–answer pairs (“1. Q: …; A: …”),  
• a description of the infographic background, and  
• a selected template with one or more layout blocks referencing a target infographic resolution (width × height, in pixels). Each block has: its index and type (text or figure), a bounding box [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] in pixels, and for text, an optional color. You will also be told the counts of figure and text layouts.

Here is your input:

- Context: "{{ context }}"

- QAs:
{%- for qa in qa_list -%}
{{ loop.index }}. Q: {{ qa.Q }}; A: {{ qa.A }}{%- if not loop.last -%}\n{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

- Infographic background: "{{ background }}"

- Selected template (Layout <idx>: <type>{% raw %} ({{color}}){% endraw %} - [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]; target infographic resolution is {{ res_w }}x{{ res_h }}):
{%- for l in layouts -%}
Layout {{ l.idx }}: {{ l.type }}{%- if l.type == "text" and l.color %} ({{ l.color }}){%- endif %} - [{{ l.bbox[0] }}, {{ l.bbox[1] }}, {{ l.bbox[2] }}, {{ l.bbox[3] }}]{%- if not loop.last -%}\n{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

- Totals: {{ n_figures }} figure layouts and {{ m_texts }} text layouts.

Now produce your output in two parts.

A) Per-layout captions (one line per layout, listed in ascending index):
Use this exact line format:
Layout {{'{{'}}idx{{'}}'}}: {{'{{'}}caption{{'}}'}}{{'{{'}}suffix{{'}}'}}

Rules for part A:
- Do NOT include coordinates or bounding boxes.
- Do NOT put “Layout <idx>” inside the caption itself; it is only the line label.
- TEXT layouts: put the caption in double quotes. If a color is specified for that text layout, append a short note outside the quotes on the same line, like: — in {{'{{'}}color{{'}}'}} text.
  • Scale caption length by relative area among text layouts (compare text-layout bounding-box areas only):
    – Large text layout → 6–10 words delivering a complete, extractable fact (or two tightly linked facts).
    – Small text layout → concise but informative.
  • Derive strictly from the Context and QAs. Preserve answer tokens exactly as given (names, dates, counts, units, spelling). Do not use question-style captions unless the exact question text appears verbatim in the inputs.
- FIGURE layouts: no quotation marks. Write a designer-ready visual description that includes:
  subject & composition (what/arrangement/scale/orientation), visual style (icon/silhouette/flat vector/outline/stylized/cartoonish) with general color treatment, shape language (rounded/sharp/geometric/organic), any texture cues (flat/subtle grain/soft shading), background treatment (solid area/subtle pattern/framed panel/border/motif), and a short clause stating how it supports the most relevant nearby text. Do not request lettering.
  • Set minimum word counts by relative area among figure layouts (compare figure-layout areas only):
    – Largest figure → ≥35 words
    – Medium figures → ≥25 words
    – Smallest figure(s) → ≥18 words

B) Final multi-paragraph caption for the full image:
- Begin exactly with: The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>".
  • Choose <TITLE> and <TOPIC> from appropriate TEXT layout captions you wrote in part A (use them verbatim, inside quotes). Do NOT add any “(Layout X)” or similar.
- Write at least three paragraphs, minimum two sentences each.
  • Paragraph 1: describe background, palette, borders/paneling (if any), and how the top section is composed.
  • Paragraph 2: describe grouping, alignment, and interactions in the middle section.
  • Paragraph 3: describe the bottom section and the overall emphasis.
- Integrate every layout exactly once in the narrative.
  • When referring to TEXT layout content, quote its caption verbatim (keep the quotes).
  • When describing FIGURE layout content, paraphrase naturally without quotes.
  • If a text layout had a specified color, mention that color once in surrounding prose (not inside the quoted text).
- Do not include coordinates, bounding boxes, arrows, or “Layout <idx>” anywhere in part B.
- Ensure the description makes the Q–A facts recoverable solely from the image.
- End the final paragraph with the exact clause: The overall style of the image is ... and complete it concisely.

Produce part A first (the per-layout list), then part B (the full caption).
