You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. Produce a single, natural-sounding caption (plain text, no outer code fences) for an infographic from a structured input containing a context paragraph, a list of Q–A pairs, an infographic background description, and a selected template listing layout indices with their types (text or figure), their bounding boxes, and for text, optional colors. The caption must let a viewer answer the questions using only the image content, with no outside knowledge.

You will be given:

- Context: "{{ context }}"

- QAs:
{%- for qa in qa_list -%}
{{ loop.index }}. Q: {{ qa.Q }}; A: {{ qa.A }}
{%- if not loop.last %}

{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

- Infographic background: "{{ background }}"

- Selected template (Layout <idx>: <type>{% raw %} ({{color}}){% endraw %} - [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]; target infographic resolution is {{ res_w }}x{{ res_h }} width x height, and all coordinates respect this resolution):
{%- for l in layouts -%}
Layout {{ l.idx }}: {{ l.type }}{%- if l.type == "text" and l.color %} ({{ l.color }}){%- endif %} - [{{ l.bbox[0] }}, {{ l.bbox[1] }}, {{ l.bbox[2] }}, {{ l.bbox[3] }}]
{%- if not loop.last %}

{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

- Total number of layouts: {{ n_figures }} figure layouts and {{ m_texts }} text layouts.

Write the caption following these rules exactly.

1) Opening sentence
   - Begin exactly with: The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>".
   - Immediately after "<TITLE>", append the assigned title layout as (Layout X). Immediately after "<TOPIC>", append the assigned topic layout as (Layout Y). These two layouts must be distinct, must be text layouts from the template, and must also be referenced later in the narrative.
   - Do not wrap the entire caption in outer quotes. Output plain text.

2) Natural, paragraph-style narrative (no stacked lists)
   - Write a coherent, multi-paragraph description using normal prose, not a laundry list.
   - Minimum detail: at least three paragraphs with at least two sentences per paragraph. The first paragraph sets background, palette, borders/paneling, and top section composition; the second covers the middle section’s grouping/alignment/interactions; the third covers the bottom section and summary emphasis.
   - Integrate each layout as a quoted caption followed immediately by its index in parentheses, using this exact inline format for both text and figure items: "<caption>" (Layout <idx>).
   - Weave layouts into sentences using connective phrasing such as “At the top,” “Below,” “Along the center,” “To the right,” “At the bottom.” Do not include coordinates or bounding boxes anywhere in the caption. Do not use special symbols such as arrows.

3) Coverage and counts (no hallucinated layouts)
   - Reference every provided layout exactly once in the narrative, and use only the layout indices from the template. Do not invent layout numbers. Do not omit any layout.
   - If a text layout specifies a color in the template, mention that color once in surrounding prose (not inside the quoted caption). Do not mention color for figure layouts except as a general style descriptor (for example, “a colored icon”).

4) Captions for text layouts (length scales by region size)
   - Derive all text captions strictly from the Context and QAs; do not introduce unsupported claims. Use answer tokens exactly as given (dates, names, counts, units) without reformatting; preserve spelling and technical terms.
   - Determine each text layout’s relative size by comparing its bounding-box area to other text layouts. Apply these word-count ranges to the quoted caption:
     • Large text layout: write between six and ten words, inclusive, conveying a complete, extractable fact or two tightly linked facts.
     • Medium text layout: write between six and ten words, inclusive, conveying a clear, extractable fact.
     • Small text layout: the model may choose an appropriate length; keep it informative and anchored to the inputs.
   - Do not use question-style captions unless the exact question text appears verbatim in the inputs.

5) Captions for figure layouts (use the same quoted format; require rich, topic-illustrative detail and a pronoun inside the quotes)
   - Figures must also use the exact quoted format: "<caption>" (Layout <idx>). Do not use the word Figure and do not add colons/dashes around the layout label.
   - Each figure caption must be a detailed, topic-illustrative visual description that a designer could implement, and it must include at least one pronoun inside the quotes (for example, she, her, he, his, they, their, it, its) referring to the subject or the visual, not placed outside the quotes.
   - Include in the figure caption: subject and composition (what is visible, primary forms, arrangement, scale, orientation); visual style (icon, silhouette, flat vector, outline, stylized, cartoonish) and general color treatment; shape language (rounded, sharp, geometric, organic) and any texture cues (flat, subtle grain, soft shading); background treatment (solid area, subtle pattern, framed panel, border, motif); and a short clause on how it semantically supports the nearest relevant text (for example, reinforces early performances, connects to debut album year), all without requesting lettering.
   - Determine each figure layout’s relative size by comparing its bounding-box area to other figure layouts, and apply these minimum word counts inside the quotes:

6) Flow, grouping, and clarity
   - Describe grouping, alignment, proximity, and relative emphasis among layouts using plain prose. Mention panels or light/dark areas if present, and explain how visual elements support the QA-critical facts. Avoid repetition and keep sentences direct.

7) Required closing
   - End the final paragraph with the exact clause: The overall style of the image is ... and complete it concisely.

Output format constraints:
- Plain text only (no code fences).
- Multi-paragraph prose as specified.
- Every layout appears exactly once as "<caption>" (Layout <idx>) embedded within sentences (no stacked list format).
- No coordinates or bounding boxes appear in the caption text (they are used only to judge relative size and flow).
