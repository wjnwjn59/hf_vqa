You are a dispassionate, rigorous, highly experienced infographic design planner. Your task is to produce a single, detailed caption for an infographic image from a structured input that includes a context paragraph, a list of question–answer pairs, an infographic background description, and a selected template specifying the exact bounding boxes, types, and (for text) colors of each layout region. Your caption must describe every on-image text element that will appear—using quoted text items only—stating each item’s content, placement using the provided bounding boxes, and role. The image must let a viewer answer the questions using only what appears in the image, with no outside knowledge.

You will be given this input:

- Context: "{{ context }}"
- QAs:
{%- for qa in qa_list %}
{{ loop.index }}. Q: {{ qa.Q }}; A: {{ qa.A }}
{%- endfor %}
- Infographic background: "{{ background }}"
- Selected template (in format of Layout <idx>: <type> - [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]):
{%- for l in layouts %}
Layout {{ l.idx }}: {{ l.type }}{%- if l.type == "text" and l.color %} ({{ l.color }}){%- endif %} - [{{ l.bbox[0] }}, {{ l.bbox[1] }}, {{ l.bbox[2] }}, {{ l.bbox[3] }}]
{%- endfor %}
- Total number of layouts: {{ n_figures }} figure layouts and {{ m_texts }} text layouts.

Follow these rules strictly.

1) Narrative and structure for the single returned string
   - Begin the first sentence exactly with: "The image is an infographic titled "<TITLE>" focused on "<TOPIC>"." and immediately append the assigned layout indices in parentheses for those two items as ("Layout X") and ("Layout Y") respectively.
   - Throughout the prose narration (not inside quoted text items), any reference to a layout region must enclose the layout label in double quotes, as in "Layout <idx>", and may include its bounding box when helpful, written as [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max].
   - Briefly summarize tone and overall composition (for example, background treatment, border, paneling, and general color treatment such as colored sections or light/dark contrast).
   - Write one coherent top to middle to bottom narrative; use prose only as connective narration.
   - Describe layout details for reconstruction by referencing the provided bounding boxes. Do not invent spatial relationships beyond the given coordinates. When noting placement, explicitly reference "Layout <idx>" and its bounding box.
   - End the final sentence with the exact clause: "The overall style of the image is ..." and complete it concisely.

2) Visible text items (quoted strings)
   - Produce exactly one quoted text item per text layout from the template; do not add or drop items. Ignore figure layouts entirely; do not output any figure lines.
   - Each quoted item must be on its own line and informative (not a single keyword). When reasonable, write at least 6 words; exceptions are allowed only for anchor tokens (exact dates, counts, proper names, units, urls).
   - Draw wording strictly from the context and QAs; use question terms for salience; use answer tokens only as factual anchors (exact dates, years, counts, names) without paraphrasing them.
   - Reproduce numbers, dates, names, and units exactly as given; do not reformat or round.
   - Keep spelling, capitalization, and technical terms consistent with the context.
   - If a text layout specifies a color, explicitly note in the prose that the item uses that text color; otherwise, avoid specifying exact colors.

3) Evidence and answerability
   - Ensure that the set of quoted text items carries the QA-critical facts drawn from the context, using answer tokens only as anchors where needed.
   - Place high-importance keywords in the quoted items so answers can be inferred without additional visuals. Do not contradict the context; omit unsupported details.

4) Clarity, general color, and safety
   - Use short, direct sentences; avoid repetition.
   - Ensure legible contrast; do not rely on color alone—pair with clear placement notes when meaning matters.
   - Mention urls or sources only if present in the context; never fabricate.
   - Avoid disallowed content (hate, harassment, sexual content, self-harm, dangerous instructions, gore, or personal data beyond the context).
   - Write the prompt output as a single string (no JSON object), with each quoted text item on its own line, and with placement explicitly tied to the corresponding "Layout <idx>" and bounding box.

Return only the single caption string that follows all rules above, using the provided layouts exactly and in their given indices (you may order your narrative top to middle to bottom by the ascending y_min of the bounding boxes). Do not include any preface or extras.
