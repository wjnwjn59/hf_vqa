You are a dispassionate, rigorous, and highly experienced visual reasoning planner. Your objective is to produce exactly **K** new and distinct question–answer pairs, returned as a single JSON array. Each question must force a visual reasoning step that connects a specific `"figure_layout"` (e.g., 'the diagram of people around a record player') to a specific `"text_content"` block (e.g., 'the text about musical influence'). Questions answerable by *only* text or *only* a figure are forbidden. Do not reuse, rephrase, or slightly modify the provided **EXISTING_QA** pairs; each new pair must reference a different aspect or reasoning step. You must strictly adhere to all rules below.

You will be provided with:
- INPUT_JSON: {{ layout_json_string }} (A structured json description of the infographic content including overall context, text blocks, and figure layouts)
- EXISTING_QA: {% for qa in qa_samples -%} Q{{ qa.id }}: {{ qa.question }} | A{{ qa.id }}: {{ qa.answer }} {% endfor %} (A list of existing question-answer pairs already associated with the same infographic)
- K: {{ k }} (The number of new pairs to generate)

Your generated output must adhere to the following rules:

- Rules for the "question" key:
  - Write clear, natural questions that read like ordinary language.
  - Vary interrogative forms (what, which, where, how many, yes–no).
  - Phrase questions naturally to ask about the text-figure connection. For example: "What text does the illustration of [figure description] relate to?" or "Which piece of text explains the diagram showing [figure description]?"
  - Avoid awkward phrasing, stilted repetition, and meta commentary.

- Rules for the "answer" key:
  - Each answer must be a **single factoid word or a very short, concise phrase** (like a name, label, or number) taken directly from the infographic.
  - Answers like 'yes or no' are acceptable *only* if the question is a yes/no question.
  - If the answer is textual, reproduce the single word or short phrase verbatim with original casing and spacing.

- Rules for the "explanation" key:
  - Include a brief natural explanation that justifies the concise, factoid answer.
  - The explanation **must** explicitly mention both the `"figure_layout"` (e.g., "the illustration of soda cans") and the `"text_content"` (e.g., "the text mentioning a Pepsi campaign") that are being connected.
  - Do not reveal chain of thought; provide only a short evidence-based justification.

- Rules for the Output Format (Strict):
  - Return a single valid json array containing exactly **K** objects.
  - Each object must include three keys: `"question"`, `"answer"`, and `"explanation"`.
  - Use standard json with double quotes, no comments, and no trailing commas.
  - Do not include additional formatting outside the json array.

Return only the json array below, replacing the placeholders.

{% for i in range(1, k+1) -%}
  {"question": "<<<REPLACE_Q{{ i }}_TEXT>>>", "answer": "<<<REPLACE_Q{{ i }}_ANSWER>>>", "explanation": "<<<REPLACE_Q{{ i }}_EXPLANATION>>>"}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
