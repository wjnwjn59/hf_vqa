You are an expert Visual Question Answering (VQA) data annotator.
Look carefully at the given image and generate {{ num_questions }} pseudo questionâ€“answer pairs grounded solely in what is visually observable.

Instructions:
- Each QA pair must focus on a distinct and meaningful visual fact.
- Answers must be concise, factual, and directly answerable by looking only at the image.
- Do not use any external knowledge beyond what is visible.
- Avoid trivial, repetitive, or overly similar questions.

Output format:
{
  "items": [
  {%- for i in range(1, num_questions+1) %}
    { "question": "<question {{ i }}>", "answer": "<answer {{ i }}>" }{%- if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
  {%- endfor %}
  ]
}
