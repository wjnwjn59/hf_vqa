The tangent function is suitable here because it relates the opposite side (BC) to the adjacent side (AB) in a right-angled triangle. By using the tangent function, we can calculate the angle at point A, which is the bearing angle. Therefore, the most appropriate geometric method is the use of trigonometric functions.</think>\n\n<answer>A</answer>"

**Note:** You should remove all `<image>` and `<video>` tokens in your dataset. It works a bit different with other training methods.

</details>

<br><br>

Adding the new domain-specific data on top of the general data from open-source data will enhance downstream capabilities while retaining the foundational skills. Of course, you can also choose to fine-tune solely on the new data based on your requirements.

## Supervised Fine Tuning

**Note:** Deepspeed zero2 is faster than zero3, however it consumes more memory. Also, most of the time zero2 is more stable than zero3.<br><br>
**Tip:** You could use `adamw_bnb_8bit` for optimizer to save memory.

To run the training script, use the following command:

### Full Finetuning

**Note:** If you want to use `unfreeze_topk_llm` or `unfreeze_topk_vision` you should set `-freeze_llm` or `--freeze_vision_tower` to `true`.

```bash
bash scripts/finetune.sh
```

### Finetune with LoRA

**Note:** Liger-kernel won't work with QLoRA. You need to disable to use QLoRA.<br>
If you want to train only the language model with LoRA and perform full training for the vision model:

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_lora.sh
```

If you want to train both the language model and the vision model with LoRA:

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_lora_vision.sh
```

**IMPORTANT:** If you want to tune the `embed_token` with LoRA, You need to tune `lm_head` together.

</details>

### Train with video dataset

You can train the model using a video dataset. You can set LoRA configs and use for LoRA too.<br>
**Note:** You could not set `fps` and `nframes` at the same time.

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_video.sh
```

**Note:** When training with video, it just as multi-image so you should adjust the `max_pixels` for maximum resolution and `fps` based on the available VRAM.

If you run out of vram, you can use [zero3_offload](./scripts/zero3_offload.json) instead of [zero3](./scripts/zero3_offload.json).<br>
You could use [zero2_offload](./scripts/zero2_offload.json) for a bit faster training.

#### Image Resolution for vram usage

The model supprots a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input.
For better performance using native or higer pixel numbers are recommended, however it takes too much memory and computation time for large images. So you could adjust the pixel numbers for it.
The model splits the image into `token * 28 * 28` so you could just change the the token_num part in the script. <br>
For example:

```
--image_min_pixels $((256 * 28 * 28))
--image_max_pixels $((1280 * 28 * 28))
--video_min_pixels $((128 * 28 * 28))
--video_max_pixels $((768 * 28 * 28))
```

Besides you could directly set the image/video height and width to control over the memory.

```
--image_resized_width 448
--image_resized_height 448
--video_resized_width 448
--video_resized_height 448
```

These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.

#### Merge LoRA Weights

```
bash scripts/merge_lora.sh
```

**Note:** Remember to replace the paths in `finetune.sh` or `finetune_lora.sh` with your specific paths. (Also in `merge_lora.sh` when using LoRA.)

## DPO Finetuning

You can train the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).<br>
The process is quite similar to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and you can also apply LoRA during DPO training just like in SFT.

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_dpo.sh
```

Most of the training arugments are same as SFT, but few other arguments are added for DPO training.

<details>
<summary>Training arguments</summary>

- `--dpo_loss` (str): Loss type for dpo. (default: 'sigmoid')
- `--precompute_ref_log_probs` (bool): Wheter to precompute the reference log probs (default: False)
- `--beta` (float): The beta value for DPO (default: 0.1)

</details>

## GRPO Finetuning

You can traing the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) <br>
The process is quite similar to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and you can also apply LoRA during GRPO training just like in SFT.<br>
<br>

### Prerequisites

| What                      | Where                       | Notes                                                                                       |

You could start training using this script.<br>
Before training, **Please check the dataset format once more.** The format is a bit different from other training methods.

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_grpo.sh
```

Most of the training arugments are same as SFT, but few other arguments are added for GRPO training.

</details>

## Classification Finetuning

### ⚠️This is an experimental feature.

The [model](src/model/modeling_cls.py) is tailored for classification tasks, such as other SequenceClassification models.

For the classification task, you need to prepare the dataset in a specific format. The dataset should be a JSON file where each entry contains an image and its corresponding label. The labels should be integers starting from 0.<br>
You can set the text in the filed `prompt` to provide a questions and options for the classification task. Also if your dataset dose not contain the `prompt` field, the script will automatically use the `USER_MESSAGE` from the [cls_dataset.py](src/dataset/cls_dataset.py).<br>

**Please see the example below for the dataset format.**<br>

<details>
<summary>Example for Classification Dataset</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "id": "06bc8a17-bb1c-4007-8c08-92c41e2628b2",
    "image": "image_2.jpg",
    "prompt": "Question: What is in the image? \n Options: \n 1. A train \n 2. A bus \n 3. A car \n 4. A bicycle",
    "label": "3",
  }
  ...
]
```

**Note:** You should set the `CLASS_2_ID` variable in the [cls_dataset.py](src/dataset/cls_dataset.py).

</details>

<br>

The dataset can contain **single/multi-image or video data**, and the model will be trained to classify the images/videos based on the provided labels.<br>

For now, you can select loss from one of the following:

- `cross_entropy`
- `focal_loss`
- `class_balanced_cross_entropy`
- `class_balanced_focal_loss`

Also you can set early stopping patience and threshold for the training.
For example, you can set `--early_stopping_patience 5` and `--early_stopping_threshold 0.01` to stop the training if the validation loss does not improve for 5 epochs with a threshold of 0.01.

Most of the training arugments are same as SFT, but few other arguments are added for classification training.<br><br>

**Tip:** In models like the Qwen family, which have strong context embeddings, even a shallow nonlinearity (a 1-layer MLP) can often improve separability in the tail. This works by introducing a bit of curvature that a purely linear head cannot provide.

<details>
<summary>Training arguments</summary>

- `--loss_type` (str): Loss type for classification (default: 'cross_entropy').
- `--focal_alpha` (str): Focal Loss alpha value. If None use CrossEntropyLoss. ex '1.0,7.5' (default: None).
- `--focal_gamma` (float): Focal Loss gamma value. (default: 0.0)
- `--num_labels` (int): Number of labels for classification
- `--class_balanced_beta` (float): Class Balanced beta value. (default: 0.999)
- `--early_stopping_patience` (int): Early stopping patience (default: 0)
- `--early_stopping_threshold` (float): Early stopping threshold (default: 0.01)
- `--mlp_head_dim` (int): Dimension of the MLP head (default: 0)
- `--mlp_head_dropout` (float): Dropout rate for the MLP head (default: 0.0)

</details>

You can run the training script using the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/finetune_cls.sh
```

#### Experimental Features

- Sampler for the dataset. The trainer scripts supports the sampler for the dataset. You could make your own sampler with inherting `DistributedSampler`.

## Inference

**Note:** You should use the merged weight when trained with LoRA.

### Gradio Infernce (WebUI)

1. Install gradio

```
pip install gradio
```

2. Launch app

```
python -m src.serve.app \
    --model-path /path/to/merged/weight
```

You can launch gradio based demo with this command. This can also set some other generation configs like `repetition_penalty`, `temperature` etc.
