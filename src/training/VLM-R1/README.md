Since the introduction of [Deepseek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1), numerous works have emerged focusing on reproducing and improving upon it. In this project, we propose VLM-R1, a stable and generalizable R1-style Large Vision-Language Model.

Specifically, for the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), we trained [Qwen2.5-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL) using both R1 and SFT approaches. The results reveal that, on the in-domain test data, the performance of the SFT model shows little change compared to that of the R1 model base model when the number of training steps is relatively small (100–600 steps), while the R1 model shows a steady improvement (as shown at the left of the figure below). More importantly, on the out-of-domain test data, the SFT model's performance deteriorates slightly as the number of steps increases. Nevertheless, the RL model generalizes its reasoning ability to the out-of-domain data (as shown at the right of the figure below).

\* *We found previous REC SFT exps used a mismatch pixel config. Therefore, we re-run the study with the correct config on a more complex out-of-domain data. See our [findings](https://om-ai-lab.github.io/2025_03_24.html) for details.*

## 🗞️ Update

- **`2025-08-29`**: 🔥🔥🔥 We have further optimized the VLM-R1 series models based on JD's latest open-source inference framework `xllm` (github is [here](https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm)). The TTFT (Time to First Token) has been reduced by 50% compared to `vllm-ascend`, and the overall throughput has increased by 127% compared to `vllm-ascend`. Please refer to [ascend_inference/910B/xllm/README.md](ascend_inference/910B/xllm/README.md) for more details.

- **`2025-08-22`**: We have adapted the VLM-R1 series models to Huawei Ascend Atlas 800T A2 and Atlas 300I Duo series using the vllm-ascend framework, further expanding the deployment scenarios and hardware compatibility of the model series. Please refer to [ascend_inference/910B/vllm_ascend/README.md](ascend_inference/910B/vllm_ascend/README.md) and [ascend_inference/300IDuo/README.md](ascend_inference/300IDuo/README.md) for more details.

- **`2025-06-26`**: We introduce a post-resize operation for the bounding box for QwenVL (both [training](src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/vlm_modules/qwen_module.py#L124-L129) and [evaluation](src/eval/test_rec_r1.py#L92-L97)) and the results are improved slightly.
- **`2025-04-16`**: We have updated the codebase to improve functionality and maintain unified implementation. Specifically, the REC process is now integrated into [grpo_jsonl.py](src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/grpo_jsonl.py) for consistency across tasks. Additionally, we introduce a new parameter, `is_reward_customized_from_vlm_module`, which enables the use of customized reward functions defined within the VLM module. When set to `true`, the reward logic is handled in either [QwenVL2Module](src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/vlm_modules/qwen_module.py) or [InternVLModule](src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/vlm_modules/internvl_module.py), depending on the selected model. Furthermore, the training log has been enhanced to provide more detailed output for easier monitoring and debugging.

## 💪🏻 Training

### Referring Expression Comprehension (REC)

#### 📚 GRPO

1. Download the [COCO Train2014 image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/omlab/VLM-R1/resolve/main/train2014.zip) and unzip it, and we refer to the image dir as `<your_image_root>`.
2. Download the [RefCOCO/+/g and LISA-Grounding Annotation files](https://huggingface.co/datasets/omlab/VLM-R1/resolve/main/rec_jsons_processed.zip) and unzip it (LISA-Grounding is used for out-of-domain evaluation).
3. Change the `data_paths` and `image_folders` in the [run_scripts/run_grpo_rec.sh](run_scripts/run_grpo_rec.sh) file.

```bash
# These jsonl files are included in the annotation files at step 2.
# Note: please use jsonl files instead of json files.
data_paths="path/to/refcoco_train.jsonl:path/to/refcocop_train.jsonl:path/to/refcocog_train.jsonl"
image_folders="path/to/coco:path/to/coco:path/to/coco"
```

4. ``bash run_scripts/run_grpo_rec.sh``

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter 'CUDA out of memory' error, you can try to reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size`.

</div>
<!-- ![image](./assets/wandb.jpg) -->

#### 📚 Multi-Node GRPO

For multi-node training, please refers to [multinode_training_demo.sh](src/open-r1-multimodal/multinode_training_demo.sh).

#### 📚 SFT

We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) to train the SFT model.

1. Clone the [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]"
```

2. Download the dataset_info.json, mllm_rec_json.json, and qwen2_5_vl_full_sft.yaml we provided [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/omlab/VLM-R1/tree/main/sft_related). Put the json files in the `LLaMA-Factory/data` directory and the yaml file in the `LLaMA-Factory/examples/train_full` directory.
3. Run the following command to train the SFT model.

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/qwen2_5_vl_full_sft.yaml
```

### For your own data

<div style="text-align: justify;">

We support data loading the jsonl data of this format in [`src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/grpo_jsonl.py`](src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/grpo_jsonl.py). Please note that you may need to use different reward functions for your specialized tasks. Welcome to PR to add your own reward functions or share any other interesting findings!

</div>

The jsonl has the format as follows:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "image": "Clevr_CoGenT_TrainA_R1/data/images/CLEVR_trainA_000001_16885.png",
  "conversations": [
    {"from": "human", "value": "<image>What number of purple metallic balls are there?"},
    {"from": "gpt", "value": "0"}
  ]
}
```

If you want to use multi-image input, you can use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "image": ["Clevr_CoGenT_TrainA_R1/data/images/CLEVR_trainA_000001_16885.png", "Clevr_CoGenT_TrainA_R1/data/images/CLEVR_trainA_000001_16886.png"],
  "conversations": [
    {"from": "human", "value": "<image><image>What number of purple metallic balls in total within the two images?"},
    {"from": "gpt", "value": "3"}
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The image path in the jsonl file should be relative to the image folder specified in `--image_folders`. The absolute path of the input image is constructed as `os.path.join(image_folder, data['image'])`. For example:

- If your jsonl has `"image": "folder1/image1.jpg"`
- And you specify `--image_folders "/path/to/images/"`
- The full image path will be `/path/to/images/folder1/image1.jpg`

Multiple data files and image folders can be specified using ":" as a separator:

```bash
--data_file_paths /path/to/data1.jsonl:/path/to/data2.jsonl \
--image_folders /path/to/images1/:/path/to/images2/
```

The script can be run like this:

```bash
# You could refer to the run_grpo_rec.sh for the example
torchrun --nproc_per_node="8" \
    --nnodes="1" \
    --node_rank="0" \
    --master_addr="127.0.0.1" \
    --master_port="12345" \
  src/open_r1/grpo_jsonl.py \
    --output_dir output/$RUN_NAME \
    --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct \
    --deepspeed ${REPO_HOME}/src/open-r1-multimodal/local_scripts/zero3.json \
    --data_file_paths /path/to/your/data.jsonl \ # can be multiple, separated by ":"
    --image_folders /path/to/your/image/folder \ # can be multiple, separated by ":"
    ...
```

<div style="text-align: justify;">

### Multi-image Input
We provide an example of multi-image script [run_grpo_gui.sh](src/open-r1-multimodal/run_scripts/run_grpo_gui.sh). This task requires the model to analyze two GUI screenshots, taken before and after a user action, to determine if any UI interaction defects are present, which is from [GUI-Testing-Arena](https://huggingface.co/datasets/songjah/GTArena-UI-Defects). Download the [image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/omlab/VLM-R1/resolve/main/gui_multi-image.zip) and unzip it into the `/path/to/images/`. Then modify the `image_folders` parameter in the script and run it.

```bash
bash run_scripts/run_grpo_gui.sh
```

</div>

## 📊 Evaluation

![image](./assets/data2.png)

1. Download the provided [LISA-Grounding images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/omlab/VLM-R1/resolve/main/lisa-test.zip).

```bash
cd ./src/eval

# Remember to change the model path, image root, and annotation path in the script
torchrun --nproc_per_node=X test_rec_r1.py # for GRPO. 'X' is the number of GPUs you have.
torchrun --nproc_per_node=X test_rec_baseline.py # for SFT.
```
