This infographic presents key facts about the Great Barrier Reef in a visually engaging and informative layout, using a combination of text and illustrations to guide the viewer through its ecological and historical significance. At the top left, the text \"<The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system>\" is prominently displayed, positioned above the main visual elements. In the upper left section, a cartoon of a coral reef with a large sign showing 'world's largest coral reef system' in stylized shapes is placed, anchoring the visual theme. Centered in the middle section, a cartoon of a vibrant underwater scene with a variety of fish in different colors captures the biodiversity of the reef. To the right of this, a cartoon of a coral reef with a variety of coral types in different shapes and colors highlights the reef's structural diversity. Below the fish illustration, the text \"<It spans over 2,300 kilometers along the northeastern coast of Australia>\" is placed at the lower left, complementing the visual of the reef's vast expanse. On the right side, a cartoon of a coral reef with a UNESCO emblem and a plaque showing '1981' in stylized shapes is positioned, visually reinforcing the text \"<The reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981>\". Further down, the text \"<It supports over 400 species of coral>\" is placed at the lower right, adjacent to the coral illustration. Finally, the text \"<The reef is home to more than 1,500 species of fish>\" is located in the lower middle, directly below the fish illustration. The overall style of the image is a playful yet informative cartoon style with bright colors and stylized elements that make the information easily digestible and visually engaging."
